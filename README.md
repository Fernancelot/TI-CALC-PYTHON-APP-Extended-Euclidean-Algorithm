**Extended Euclidean Algorithm PYTHON application for the TI-84 PLUS CE PYTHON edition calculator**

• This program implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD of two integers and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b).
• The program takes two integers as input and returns the GCD and the coefficients x and y.
• The extended_euclid function uses recursion to calculate the GCD and the coefficients x and y.
• The main function takes user input for the two integers and calls the extended_euclid function to display the results.
• The program handles invalid input by catching ValueError exceptions and displaying an error message.
• The main function is called to run the program.
• The program can be run and tested with different input values to verify the correctness of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm
